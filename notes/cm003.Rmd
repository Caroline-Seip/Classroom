# Learning Objectives

By the end of today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Name the most important data structures in R
- know about useful resources online to get help with R, and technical tools in general.
- design effective questions through minimum workable examples (MWE's).

## Local version control

- Great resource on undoing: https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/
- Demonstrate usage of RStudio's git client

## Old notes for working locally:


GitHub can't offer the suite of editing capabilities that you have on your local machine. So we set up a _local_ version of the repo and communicate with the _remote_ repo. 

- Exercise 5: (Do together) Connect RStudio to git and GitHub
    - Did you `config` git? Enter the commands (with your credentials) specified at the top of [this](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html#hello-git) page.
    - Psst... what is this "terminal" or "shell"? A "control center" for your computer (and remote servers!)
    - _Clone_ your github repo to your local machine in RStudio. [instructions](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html#clone-the-new-github-repository-to-your-computer-via-rstudio)
        - Don't have the "Version Control" option after clicking File -> New Project? Follow [these](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html) instructions.
    - Open your README file, and add a line. Could be `I added this line locally.`
        - YES RStudio can be used as a regular text editor!
    - Go over to the `git` tab. Stage, commit, pull, and push your change.
    - Navigate to your remote repo. Do you see the change? You should!
    
- Exercise 6: (Do yourself) Toy line
    - Make a new R script in your local repo.
    - Go [here](http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html#rstudio-projects) and copy-and-paste the "toy line" script (chunks 3,4,5 in that section).
    - Click "compile notebook" on it!
    - Commit these changes, and push to your repo (after `pull`ing!)
    - Do you see the change on your remote repo?
- Advanced stuff.
    - FYI: Alternatives to GitHub: bare repo on your own server.
    - Merge conflicts. Branch. Revert.
        - Do via source tree, or bash.
        
Git take-home Lessons

- Working with git:
    - local repository: a self-contained project on your computer
    - remote repository: that project on some "cloud", like GitHub, BitBucket, your own server, ...
    - git client: program on your computer that helps you use git (commit, push, pull, ...)
- Adopt git in your workflow! This means:
    - Dedicate a self-contained directory to your project.
    - Set up an R project for the directory.
    - Set up git for that directory. 
    - __Save__ perpetually, __commit__ often, __pull/push__ (to github) periodically!
- git can be painful.
    - Problems? Often best to just burn it down and start fresh...
    - Documentation difficult to read. Check out [this parody](https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/) of github documentation. 
    - Use a git client to make it easier to work with git. RStudio, Source Tree, GitHub desktop, ...
