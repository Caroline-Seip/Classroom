## Announcements

- Assignment 01 is due tonight!
- Assignment 02 released today.
- Update on getting help in class: let's take this approach:
    - TAâ€™s more mobile during lecture
    - Students: 
        - Question for the class: hands up fully. 
        - Question for TA's: something different of your choice. Maybe a wave, holding up a pen/object, hand not fully extended, ...
    - I'll aim to take a brief break in class, but with a challenge exercise for those not needing the break.
- We'll be more strict on your participation as of this week. This means your commit timestamp matters! Your commit(s) shouldn't be made too long after lecture. I'll aim to include this in our demonstrations.

## Review

We've done a lot so far! Let's recap/review. Here are the main concepts we've covered:

- git and GitHub concepts and how-to
- Basics of R
- Basics of authoring in markdown (with various flavours)
- RStudio features:
    - as a text editor (.md, .R, .Rmd, etc...)
    - as containing the R machinery (running code in the console)
    - as a command line tool
    - as a git client

In short, we've covered the foundation of key _tools_ for data analysis. For the next few weeks, we're going to focus more on the data itself, for the purpose of _exploratory data analysis_. Specifically, and not in this particular order, 

- Data wrangling
- Data computations
- Plotting

## Today's Topics

Today we'll introduce the `dplyr` package. Specifically, we'll look at these three topics:

- Intro to `dplyr` syntax
- The `dplyr` advantage
- Relational/comparison and logical operators in R

## Resources

All three of today's topics are closely aligned to the [stat545: dplyr-intro](http://stat545.com/block009_dplyr-intro.html).

More detail can be found in the [r4ds: transform](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter, up until and including the `select()` section. Section 5.2 also elaborates on relational/comparison and logical operators in R

A similar resource to the r4ds one above is the [intro to dplyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html), up until and including the `select()` section.

## Participation

To get participation points for today, we'll be filling out the [cm005-exercise.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/notes/cm005-exercise.Rmd) file, and adding it to your participation repo:

1. I made it easier to download this time: just click the upper-right drop-down menu [of the html version](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm005-exercise.html).
2. Download the `.Rmd` version to your local participation repo.
    - You should have it cloned to your local machine (aka your computer) from last time.
3. _Optional, by recommended_: Stage and commit the Rmd file (you can do this through RStudio).
    - You can still get participation marks by uploading the final files to GitHub.

# Intro to `dplyr` syntax

## Learning Objectives

Here are the concepts we'll be exploring in this lesson:

- tidyverse
- `dplyr` functions:
    - select
    - arrange
    - filter
- piping

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- start to see the value of the `dplyr` package
- subset and rearrange data with `dplyr`
- use piping (`%>%`) when implementing function chains

## Preamble

Let's talk about:

- The history of `dplyr`: `plyr`
- tibbles are a special type of data frame
- the tidyverse

## Demonstration

Let's get started with the exercise:

1. Open RStudio, and download the `tidyverse` meta-package by executing `install.packages("tidyverse")` into the R console.
2. _Optional_: open the `STAT545_participation` RStudio project in RStudio.
3. With RStudio, open the `cm005-exercise.Rmd` file you downloaded and committed earlier.
4. Follow the instructions in the `.Rmd` file.
5. Knit, commit, push.

# The `dplyr` advantage

## Learning Objectives

Here are the concepts we'll be exploring in this lesson:

- metaprogramming: pros and cons
- self-documenting code; compare to the "base R way"
    - no need to take excerpts of your data, esp. using magic numbers
- pure functions:
    - I=O, and does not impact workspace

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Have a sense of why `dplyr` is advantageous compared to the "base R" way with respect to the above concepts. 

## Compare base R to `dplyr`

# Small break

Here are some things you might choose to do on this break:

- Talk with a TA, Vincenzo, or your neighbour(s) about the content so far.
- Fill out the challenge on the `cm005-exercise.Rmd` file.
- Work on an assignment.

# Relational/Comparison and Logical Operators in R

## Learning Objectives

Here are the concepts we'll be exploring in this lesson:

- Relational/Comparison operators
- Logical operators

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Predict the output of R code containing the above operators.
- Explain the difference between `&`/`&&` and `|`/`||`, and name a situation where one should be used over the other.

## Demonstration

Continue along with the `cm005-exercise.Rmd` file.
