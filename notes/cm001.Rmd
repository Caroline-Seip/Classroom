# Today's Outline

Here's our agenda for today. But first, lids down, please!

1. Go over the [course syllabus](http://stat545.com/Classroom).
2. Every [20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxGWsHYITAw), do an activity:
    - GitHub activity
    - Navigation activity
    - Discussion Issues activity
3. 

By the end of today’s class, students are expected to be able to:

- Navigate the STAT 545 “framework”
- Describe our expectations of you as a student
- Name families of tools that aid in data analytics


- Be oriented with the course structure and resources
- Understand how to get help within the course -- we'll cover "getting help out in the world" next time.
- Be exposed to the main themes of the course, and understand their value.
- Gain exposure to the command line, and some basic things one can do with it.
- Have created a GitHub account, and have installed RStudio.
- Understand what a plain text file is, their value, and alternatives (that are less desireable for data analytic work).
- Know how to make plain text files with RStudio.
- Markdown
- Assignment 1
