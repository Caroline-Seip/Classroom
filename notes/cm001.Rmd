## Meet your classmates

Get to know your neighbour! Choose someone to go first. In [2 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48z7nQaehWI), share:

- Your name
- Your program
- Something notable you did over the summer

Then switch for another two minutes.

Afterwards: let's here from a few of you!

# Today's Outline

Here's our agenda for today. 

1. Go over the [course syllabus](http://stat545.com/Classroom).
3. Light exposure to some course tools: GitHub, the command line, markdown: [20 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxGWsHYITAw) periods.
2. Do an activity: [5 minute]() periods. 
    - GitHub activity
    - Navigation activity
    - Discussion Issues activity

By the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:

- Understand what is expected of them in the course
- List four ways to get help/converse about the course
- Navigate the STAT 545 GitHub framework, and their own profile
- Create and comment on GitHub Issues
- Explain how the course mantras apply in the case of this webpage
- Navigate the files of your computer using the command line

# The syllabus

Let's go over the [syllabus](http://stat545.com/Classroom) and the course assignments. 

Other course destinations: defer until after we're familiar with GitHub.

# GitHub as a file-sharing and storage solution

Checklist:

- What are: Repositories (aka. "repo"s)
- Why: README's
- What are: Issues
- What are: Organizations
- What are: Teams
- What is: GitHub pages

Next time: GitHub as a version-control system. 

# Course Destinations: revisited

Checklist:

- Org/repo/website diagram of STAT 545 destinations.
- Let's spend time on:
    - Discussion repositories. 
    - Students Org

# Course Mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again. 

- Embrace plain text (as opposed to rich text) when authoring. (What is plain text?)
- Think in terms of source and output, and remember that source is real. 
- Your stuff should be reproducible. Document, test, and leave a breadcrumb trail (version control), even when you are the only collaborator. 

__Example__: markdown -> HTML. This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/notes/cm001.Rmd) on GitHub.

# The Shell

We will avoid this when we can, but we'll at least need it to install _git_ later. Here is the minimum need-to-know about the __shell__:

- Way to control your computer.
- OS-specific language!
    - Mac/linux/unix are about the same.
    - Windows has its own
- Navigate with `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`. `.` and `..`.

A great introduction to this stuff is in [happygitwithr: Appendix A](http://happygitwithr.com/shell.html).

# Activities

## GitHub activity

1. Register for a GitHub.com account. Don't pay!

2. Navigate to the [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) repository.
3. Click `Watch` on the upper-right corner of the repo, so that you get email notifications. 
4. Go to the Issues section of the repository, and comment on the Issue I created called "Introduce yourself!". In the comment, say who you are, and greet the person above you -- be sure to tag them by their username!
    - NOTE: The `Discussion-Internal` repo will be made private soon (you'll have access).
5. Complete the survey
6. Please put up a profile photo -- it makes the STAT 545 community more personable. You can do this from your profile homepage.
