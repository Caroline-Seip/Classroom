# Today's Outline

Here's our agenda for today. But first, lids down, please!

1. Go over the [course syllabus](http://stat545.com/Classroom).
2. Every [20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxGWsHYITAw), do an activity:
    - GitHub activity
    - Navigation activity
    - Discussion Issues activity
3. 

By the end of today’s class, students are expected to be able to:

- Navigate the STAT 545 “framework”
- Describe our expectations of you as a student
- Name families of tools that aid in data analytics


- Be oriented with the course structure and resources
- Understand how to get help within the course -- we'll cover "getting help out in the world" next time.
- Be exposed to the main themes of the course, and understand their value.
- Gain exposure to the command line, and some basic things one can do with it.
- Have created a GitHub account, and have installed RStudio.
- Understand what a plain text file is, their value, and alternatives (that are less desireable for data analytic work).
- Know how to make plain text files with RStudio.
- Markdown
- Assignment 1

# STAT 545 framework: checklist

1. Syllabus
2. GitHub as a storage and file-sharing service:

# Some Tools

# Course Mantras

- Embrace plain text
    - Always readable; no surprise re-formatting.
    - When authoring: Distraction-free.
- Source is real
- Can you reproduce that?

__Example__: markdown -> HTML. This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/notes/cm001.Rmd).

## GitHub as a file-sharing and storage solution

Checklist:

- What are: Repositories
- Why: README's
- How: Drag-and-drop file addition
- What are: Issues
- What are: Organizations
- What are: Teams

Tomorrow: GitHub as a version-control system. 

## The Command Line

We will avoid this when we can. Here is the minimum need-to-know about the __command line__:

- Way to control your computer.
- OS-specific language!
    - Mac/linux/unix are about the same.
    - Windows has its own
- Navigate with `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`. `.` and `..`.
- Related terminology:
    - The command line is your system's _shell_
    - _Bash_ is the Unix scripting language
    - _Terminal_ is a command line interface 

# Activities

## GitHub activity

- Register for a GitHub.com account. Don't pay!
    - Want detailed instructions? See  [happygitwithr: Section 5](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
- Also, please put up a headshot.

## Course Navigation activity

- Find the assignments. When is the first one due? Where is it due? How do you submit?

## Discussion Issues activity

- "Watch" the Discussion-Internal repo
- Reply to the issue introducing yourself. Tag the person immediately above you. 

BONUS: Register for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) with GitHub. It's free!

## Install your stuff

1. Install R and RStudio.
    - R here: <https://cloud.r-project.org>
    - RStudio here: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>
    - Commentary on installing this stuff can be found at [stat545.com: r-rstudio-install](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html)
2. Install git. See [happygitwithr: Section 7](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
    - You'll need to work with the command line.
