- Be oriented with the course structure and resources
- Understand how to get help within the course -- we'll cover "getting help out in the world" next time.
- Be exposed to the main themes of the course, and understand their value.
- Gain exposure to the command line, and some basic things one can do with it.
- Have created a GitHub account, and have installed RStudio.
- Understand what a plain text file is, their value, and alternatives (that are less desireable for data analytic work).
- Know how to make plain text files with RStudio.
- Markdown
