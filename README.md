# STAT 545: Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R, Part I

This is the course syllabus for the Fall 2018 edition of STAT 545 (click [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/syllabus-547.md) for the STAT 547M syllabus). You should use this syllabus to:

1. find information about the course, and
2. navigate the course.

## Quick Navigation

Both STAT 545 and STAT 547M make use of the following tools:

| Tool + Link | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| <http://stat545.com/Classroom> (here) | Think of this as the course "home" -- and this syllabus as your launch pad to other destinations. Contains lecture notes, assignments, and course information. |
| <http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments> | Assignments and assignment info can be found here. |
| [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) GitHub repository | For internal discussion. The world cannot see this. |
| [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) GitHub repository. | For public discussion. The world can see this. |
| [STAT545-UBC-students](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students) GitHub Organization | This will contain one GitHub repository per student, for you to submit homework to and give peer reviews. |
| [UBC canvas](http://canvas.ubc.ca/) | This is for grade management. You'll be interacting with it by submitting a link to your homework. |
| <http://stat545.com> | This holds course content, such as tutorials. Think of this as a textbook. We'll point you there when needed. This previously contained the information contained in `Classroom`, but that eventually became confusing. Some headers there are becoming deprecated.  |

This framework of tools is under construction, as we move to a solution that's more scalable in terms of future iterations and multiple collaborators. We appreciate your patience and welcome your feedback!

## About STAT 545

### Course Description

STAT 545 is "Part I" of learning how to

- explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data
- make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable
- using R

Part II is STAT 547M -- hope to see you there, too!

### Course Learning Objectives:

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

-
### Timing and Location

This course runs from September 4 until October 18, 2018.

We'll meet as a class every Tuesday and Thursday, 09:30-11:00, in ESB 2012.

### Roots

Jenny Bryan deserves a huge amount of credit for founding and developing both STAT 545 and 547M over many years, along with her TA's. Thank you!

## Evaluation

[(Navigation link to Assignments)](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/)

To gain marks in this course, you'll be completing five assignments, and submitting two peer reviews for each assignment. Participation counts too!

Here's the breakdown of your course grade:

| Assessment | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| 5 Assignments | 75% (15% per assignment) |
| 10 Peer Reviews | 15% (3% per assignment) |
| Participation | 10% |

There is no final exam. 

Auditing students must still complete and submit all assessments, to be graded on a pass/fail basis. 

__Assignments and peer review__: For information about and links to assignments and peer reviews, go to [the assignments page](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/). 

__Participation__: will be evaluated by:

- Participation in class discussions
- Submitting work on in-class activities to your STAT 545 home GitHub repository.
    - Be sure to submit these in class, not at some other time!
- Activity in the Issues of the two `Discussion` repositories -- with preference given to [`Discussion`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion)  (public) over [`Discussion-Internal`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private).

## Conversation

We strongly encourage you to communicate with the teaching team _and_ your classmates. The best way to do this is by posting an Issue in one of the two `Discussion` GitHub repositories:

1. Want to talk about content/coding issues? Post an Issue in the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) (public) repository.
2. Want to talk about the course? Post an Issue in the [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private) repository.
3. Want to privately contact Vincenzo? Feel free to send me an email.
    - I look forward to receiving your email, though I do encourage you to post in one of the `Discussion` repositories unless it's really not appropriate for either platform. 

__Note__:

- To get the attention of the teaching team, add the `@2018_teaching_team` tag to notify all five of us.
- To get the attention of your fellow students, add the `@2018_students` tag to notify them.
- Don't just create Issues -- also respond to them! Think about this in terms of adding to the conversation, not in terms of "correctness". 

## Annotated Resources

Here are the resources we will be referring to throughout the course, along with a brief description of the resource. 

Overarching resources:

1. <http://stat545.com>
    - As mentioned earlier, this website can be thought of as a textbook for STAT 545/547.
2. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (aka "r4ds"), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
    - STAT 545/547 closely mirrors the topics of this book, making this book more of a true "textbook" for the course.

Resources for more specific topics:

1. [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/), by Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 TA's
    - Great for marrying git, GitHub, R, and RStudio in your workflow.
2. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham
    - If you want to learn more about R as a programming language, this is a very readable and concise way of doing so.
3. [ggplot2 book](http://webcat2.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8489511), by Hadley Wickham
    - Useful for digging deeper into `ggplot2`.
