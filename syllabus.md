# STAT 545: Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R, Part I

This is the course syllabus for the Fall 2018 edition of STAT 545 (click [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/syllabus-547.md) for the STAT 547M syllabus). You should use this syllabus to:

1. find information about the course, and
2. navigate the course.

## About STAT 545

### Course Description

STAT 545 is "Part I" of learning how to

- explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data
- make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable
- using R

Part II is STAT 547M -- hope to see you there, too!

### Course Learning Objectives:

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

-
### Timing and Location

This course runs from September 4 until October 18, 2018.

We'll meet as a class every Tuesday and Thursday, 09:30-11:00, in ESB 2012.

### Roots

Jenny Bryan deserves a huge amount of credit for founding and developing both STAT 545 and 547M over many years, along with her TA's. Thank you!

## Course Destinations

Both STAT 545 and STAT 547M make use of the following tools:

1. [Classroom](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom) GitHub repository.
    - Think of this as the course "home" -- and this syllabus as your launch pad to other destinations. 
    - Contains lecture notes, assignments, and course information.
2. [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) GitHub repository.
    - For internal discussion. The world cannot see this.
3. [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) GitHub repository.
    - For public discussion. The world can see this.
4. [STAT545-UBC-students](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students) GitHub Organization.
    - This will contain one GitHub repository per student, for you to submit homework to and give peer reviews.
5. [UBC canvas](http://canvas.ubc.ca/)
    - This is for grade management. You'll be interacting with it by submitting a link to your homework. 
6. <http://stat545.com>.
    - This holds course content, such as tutorials. Think of this as a textbook. We'll point you there when needed. 
    - Used to contain the information contained in `Classroom`. That eventually became confusing. Some headers there are becoming deprecated.

Please see the "Conversation" section below to determine who to get in touch with for what, and how.

__Office hours__: Want to talk about the course outside of lecture? Let's talk during these dedicated times. You're always welcome to schedule alternative times, too.

## Conversation

We strongly encourage you to communicate with the teaching team _and_ your classmates. The best way to do this is by posting an Issue in one of the two `Discussion` GitHub repositories:

1. Want to talk about content/coding issues? Post an Issue in the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) (public) repository.
2. Want to talk about the course? Post an Issue in the [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private) repository.
3. Want to privately contact Vincenzo? Feel free to send me an email.
    - I look forward to receiving your email, though I do encourage you to post in one of the `Discussion` repositories unless it's really not appropriate for either platform. 

__Note__:

- To get the attention of the teaching team, add the `@2018_teaching_team` tag to notify all five of us.
- To get the attention of your fellow students, add the `@2018_students` tag to notify them.
- Don't just create Issues -- also respond to them! Think about this in terms of adding to the conversation, not in terms of "correctness". 

## Class Meetings

Here are the topics and links to the notes for each class meeting. 

Warning: adjustments are still being made!

## Evaluation

To gain marks in this course, you'll be completing five assignments, and submitting two peer reviews for each assignment. Participation counts too!

Here's the breakdown of your course grade:

| Assessment | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| 5 Assignments | 75% (15% per assignment) |
| 10 Peer Reviews | 15% (3% per assignment) |
| Participation | 10% |

There is no final exam. 

### Assignments and Peer Review

Here are the deadlines assignments and peer reviews, with links (to appear after assignments are released). All submissions are due by 11:59pm.

| Assignment  | Assignment Due Date | Peer Review Due Date |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Homework 01 | September 18, 2018  | September 24, 2018 |
| Homework 02 | September 25, 2018  | October 01, 2018 |
| Homework 03 | October 02,   2018  | October 08, 2018 |
| Homework 04 | October 09,   2018  | October 15, 2018 |
| Homework 05 | October 19,   2018  | October 24, 2018 |

The logistics are as follows:

1. When an assignment is released, I will post a GitHub Issue in [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal), tagging the teaching team and students (you should get an email notification, too, unless you've somehow disabled this).
2. You develop your homework responses on your STAT545 home GitHub repository, contained in the [STAT545-UBC-students](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students) Organization.
3. When your homework is complete, tag a release of your repository before the deadline, and submit a link to the release on [UBC canvas](canvas.ubc.ca).
4. You will be notified of two classmates to provide a peer review. Check out their submission, then write your feedback as an Issue in their repository before the deadline.
    - There is no need to tag the teaching team!

### Participation

Participation will be evaluated by:

- Participation in class discussions
- Submitting work on in-class activities to your STAT 545 home GitHub repository.
    - Be sure to submit these in class, not at some other time!
- Activity in the Issues of the two `Discussion` repositories -- with preference given to [`Discussion`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion)  (public) over [`Discussion-Internal`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private).

## Annotated Resources

Here are some resources to learn more about each of the tools we're using.

Prominent resources:

1. <http://stat545.com>
    - As mentioned earlier, this website can be thought of as a textbook for STAT 545/547.
2. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (aka "r4ds"), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
    - STAT 545/547 closely mirrors the topics of this book, making this book more of a true "textbook" for the course.

Resources for more specific topics:

1. [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/), by Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 TA's
    - Great for marrying git, GitHub, R, and RStudio in your workflow.
2. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham
    - If you want to learn more about R as a programming language, this is a very readable and concise way of doing so.
3. [ggplot2 book](http://webcat2.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8489511), by Hadley Wickham
    - Useful for digging deeper into `ggplot2`.
