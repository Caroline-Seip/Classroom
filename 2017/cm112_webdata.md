### cm111 2017-11-30 Thursday overview


  * [Homework 9 Build your own R package](hw09_package.html) Peer review open.
  * [Homework 10 Get data from the web](hw10_data-from-web.html) is due **the following Thursdat, December 7**.
    - For the homework, we offer lots of prompts, including what you see in last year's version, so you can choose to work with a wrapped or unwrapped API or webscraping.
  * This week is about accessing data from the web from R. In class we scraped a lyrics website to perform some sentiment analysis. The workthrough we used is [here](./111Scraping_Workthrough.html): what's missing it's the scavenging hunt we have done with Firefox to fine css classes and patterns in how the data is presented. Today we also covered [`httr`](https://github.com/r-lib/httr) and APIs. Read through its [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/quickstart.html) and the link therein. Another good tutorial is [this one](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/r_and_apis/) by Tyler Clavelle.
  * More materials prepared by Karthik Ram and Scott Chamberlain (rOpenSci) and Garrett Grolemund (Rstudio):
