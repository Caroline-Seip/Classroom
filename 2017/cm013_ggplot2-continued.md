### cm013 2017-10-17 Tuesday overview

#### Housekeeping

- Tomorrow, Dr. Tamara Munzner will be giving a guest lecture on data visualization. She's a [prominent thought leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization) in the field. Wrote quite a profound [book](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) on vis.
- Your peer reviews for Homework 04 should have been submitted by last night.
- Homework 05 due Friday October 20, 2017
    - This is the last homework of STAT 545.
- Peer review for Homework 05 due Monday October 23 2017. Also an unusual time. That concludes STAT 545.

#### Today 

We will spend today on `ggplot2`, looping back now that you have a fair amount of experience. We might not get through all of today's notes -- the rest will remain as a resource.

- [Notes and Exercises](http://stat545.com/cm013-notes_and_exercises.html)
- [raw Rmd version](http://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm013-notes_and_exercises.Rmd).
