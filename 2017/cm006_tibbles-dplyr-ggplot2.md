### cm006 2017-09-21 Thursday overview

#### Housekeeping

- Peer review for homework 01 is ready. Check the Homework 01 page. 
    - Due Monday, but preferably do sooner so that you can learn from your mistakes!

#### Today

- Continue working on `dplyr` [activities](http://stat545.com/cm005-notes_and_exercises.html) from last time. Raw Rmd file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/master/cm005-notes_and_exercises.Rmd).
- A first look at `ggplot2`. We'll follow along with the [Notes and Exercises](https://stat545.com/cm006-notes_and_exercises.html). I suggest downloading and filling in your responses from the [raw Rmd version](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm006-notes_and_exercises.Rmd) 

#### Resources

- See [cm005](http://stat545.com/cm005_tidyverse-tibbles.html) for `dplyr` resources
- Jenny's [`ggplot2` tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial) and corresponding [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial)
- `ggplot2` [official website](http://ggplot2.org/) -- has other resources too.
- [The R Graphics Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do), an excellent book by Winston Chang. 
    - The [graphs section](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) of Winston Chang's website Cookbook for R. The book listed above contains much more material, but the website is good too.
- A [`ggplot2` tutorial](http://stcorp.nl/R_course/tutorial_ggplot2.html) by Paul Hiemstra, one of [many excellent R courses](http://stcorp.nl/R_course/) he offers.
- [A quick introduction to ggplot2](http://inundata.org/2013/04/10/a-quick-introduction-to-ggplot2/) by Karthik Ram. Slides and code from a 2 hour talk/hands on presentation for ggplot2 beginners.

Why do I teach `ggplot2`? Shouldn't beginners see "base" graphics first? I think not. David Robinson explains it well in [Don't teach built-in plotting to beginners (teach ggplot2)](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/).

Zev Ross has a lovely blog post: [Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/)
