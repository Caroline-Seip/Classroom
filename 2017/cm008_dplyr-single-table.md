### cm008 2017-09-28 Thursday overview

#### Housekeeping

- Homework 02 peer review is open. Due Monday.
- Grades for Homework 01 are coming soon.
- You should be working on Homework 03.

#### Today

We're ahead of schedule. Let's talk about some useful things that I've skipped over, in today's [cm008 Notes and Exercises](https://stat545.com/cm008-notes_and_exercises.html). [raw Rmd version](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm008-notes_and_exercises.Rmd).

#### Resources

- [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
- The `broom` package makes the output from statistical models in R less cryptic. Check out [its vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html).
- `dplyr` has a [window-functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) vignette that explains about window functions. Useful for grouped mutate.
- There are ["complete themes"](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) that come with `ggplot2`.
- For _scales_ in ggplot, check out [this tutorial by Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/blob/master/scales.rmd).
