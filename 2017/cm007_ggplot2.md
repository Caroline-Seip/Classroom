#### Housekeeping

- Your peer reviews for Homework 01 should have been submitted by last night.
- Homework 02 due today by midnight. Peer review to be posted soon after. 
- Homework 03 has been posted. Check the syllabus page.
- Might be missing 4 (probably more) people on Slack. Email me to ask for an invitation. There are announcements and helpful advice that goes on there.

#### Today

- Review:
    - difference between `ggplot` and `ggplot2`. 
    - syntax we've seen so far: `data` and `mapping` arguments. 
- Finish exercises in [cm006 Notes and Exercises](https://stat545.com/cm006-notes_and_exercises.html). [raw Rmd version](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm006-notes_and_exercises.Rmd).
    - Warning: I updated the Rmd and md files, so be careful not to override your own notes!
- Complete our introduction to `ggplot2` with [cm007 Notes and Exercises](https://stat545.com/cm007-notes_and_exercises.html). [raw Rmd version here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm007-notes_and_exercises.Rmd).

#### Resources
