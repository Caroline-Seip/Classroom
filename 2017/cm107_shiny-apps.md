### cm107 2017-11-14 Tuesday overview

We'll be using [this hack pad](https://hackmd.io/KYTgZgDAhgRgJnAtADgKwgEyICwwMyooDGEwiRqR2GA7JRgIw0BsQA==) for real-time Q&A and code sharing. If you need to share some code or send a chat message to the instructor or other classmates, feel free to use that webpage. It's markdown. This will make it easier to ask Giulio questions, or let other students see that you're having the same problem as them.
