### cm111 2017-11-28 Tuesday overview

  * [Homework 8 Build a Shiny app](hw08_shiny.html) should be submitted, if you are doing it, because today I will inspect the issues to determine who did it and deal with peer review.
  * [Homework 9 Build your own R package](hw09_package.html) is due today.
  * [Homework 10 Get data from the web](hw10_data-from-web.html) is due **on Monday, December 4**, if you do it, because we need to finalize marks.
    - For the homework, I'll offer lots of prompts, including what you see in last year's version, so you can choose to work with a wrapped or unwrapped API or webscraping.
  * This week is about accessing data from the web from R. In class, we'll follow the material @gvdr prepared for you. You can follow it [here](./111Scraping_Workthrough.html)
  
  
Additional resources are the material prepared by Karthik Ram and Scott Chamberlain (rOpenSci) and Garrett Grolemund (Rstudio):
