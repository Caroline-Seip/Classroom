### cm005 2017-09-19 Tuesday overview

#### Housekeeping

* You should submit [Homework 01](hw01_edit-README.html) sometime today!
    - Get help in class [office hours](http://stat545.com/syllabus.html) if you're struggling.
    - Peer review will go at the bottom of Homework 01 page. You'll be notified via Slack when it has been updated and when action is required. 
    - Deadlines for assignments and peer reviews have been put in plain view on syllabus page. 
* Giulio is now taking cm010-cm012, not cm008-cm010. Updated on syllabus page.
* [Homework 02](hw02_explore-gapminder-dplyr.html) is ready, and due next Tuesday (Sept 25).
    - You might not be getting a repo on the stat545 org.

#### Today

For now, don't worry about data structures in R such as vectors, lists, and matrices. We'll see these later.

Today's lecture notes can be found [here](http://stat545.com/cm005-notes_and_exercises.html). I recommend modifying your own copy of these lecture notes in class. The raw RmD file can be found [github repo underpinning this website](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm005-notes_and_exercises.Rmd).

The resources underpinning today's class are:

1. [Care and Feeding of Data in R](http://stat545.com/block006_care-feeding-data.html)
2. `dplyr` resources: [part 1](http://stat545.com/block009_dplyr-intro.html) and [part 2](http://stat545.com/block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html).
3. [R for Data Science, Ch5](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) for `dplyr`. 

#### Before next class

- I suggest reading [part 1](http://stat545.com/block009_dplyr-intro.html) and [part 2](http://stat545.com/block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html) of Jenny's `dplyr` tutorial.
