### cm110 2017-11-23 Thursday overview

#### Today

Continuation of last time. We'll be working from the same files as last time. Links:

- [Lecture tutorial](cm109-110-notes_and_exercises.html) -- updated to include more. 
- [Comprehensive tutorial](packages06_foofactors-package.html) by Jenny Bryan. 

As last time, if you are ahead of the class, add more stuff to your R package for [Homework 9](hw09_package.html), and we'll be around to help you with any questions you have. 

The final `powers` package can be found on [my github page](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/powers).
