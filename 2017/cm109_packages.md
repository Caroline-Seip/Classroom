### cm109 2017-11-21 Tuesday overview

#### Announcements

- About me; my office hours (different this week).
- [Homework 8 Build a Shiny app](hw08_shiny.html) is due by tonight.
- [Homework 9 Build an R package](hw09_package.html) is posted.

#### Today (and next time)

We'll go through the [tutorial](cm109-110-notes_and_exercises.html), which is a "lecture template" of the more comprehensive [tutorial by Jenny Bryan](packages06_foofactors-package.html).

During exercise periods, in case you're ahead of the class and have time, you should work on [Homework 9](hw09_package.html).

#### Resources

Two informative resources to help you build R packages are:

- Jenny's ["Write your own R package"](http://stat545.com/packages00_index.html).
    - This contains even more resources. 
- Hadley's ["R packages"](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book.
