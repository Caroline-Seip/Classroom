- Some resources on structuring your project files.
    - Here's how project files are encouraged to be structured in the UBC Master of Data Science program:
        - all code files (`.R`, `.py`, `.Rmd`, `.ipynb`) live in the `src` directory, except for the driver scripts (Shell script and Makefile which call your analysis scripts).
        - all rendered documents and visualizations you create live in the `results` directory
        - any data present goes in the `data` directory
        - manuscripts live in the `doc` directory.
    - Make your repo [browsable](http://happygitwithr.com/repo-browsability.html).
