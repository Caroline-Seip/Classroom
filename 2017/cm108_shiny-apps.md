### cm108 2017-11-16 Thursday overview

You should have completed sections 1-8 on the [Shiny Tutorial](shiny01_activity.html) prior to today and review what we did in class.

Today we will pick up where we left off: [Shiny tutorial part 2](http://stat545.com/shiny01_activity.html#implement-server-logic-to-create-outputs).

We'll also be using [this hack pad](https://hackmd.io/KYTgZgDAhgRgJnAtADgKwgEyICwwMyooDGEwiRqR2GA7JRgIw0BsQA==) for real-time Q&A and code sharing. If you need to share some code or send a chat message to the instructor or other classmates, feel free to use that webpage. It's markdown. This will make it easier to ask Giulio questions, or let other students see that you're having the same problem as them.
