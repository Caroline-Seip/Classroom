#### STAT 547M: Basic Training for Data Science

This is the course syllabus for the Fall 2018 edition of STAT 547M (click [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/syllabus-545.md) for the STAT 545 syllabus preceding this course). You should use this syllabus to:

1. find information about the course, and
2. navigate the course.

## About STAT 5457M

### Course Description

STAT 547M is "Part II" of learning how to

- explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data
- make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable
- using R

Part I was STAT 545.

### Selected Topics

* Be the boss of non-numeric data, esp. character and factor
* Interactive pages, apps, and graphics with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com)
* Get data off the web and expose data, code, results on the web
* Distribute data and code via an R package
* Automate an analytical pipeline, e.g. via `Make`

### Timing and Location

This course runs from October 23 until November 29, 2018.

We'll meet as a class every Tuesday and Thursday, 09:30-11:00, in ESB 2012.

I'll aim to end class at 10:45. 

### Roots

Jenny Bryan deserves a huge amount of credit for founding and developing both STAT 545 and 547M over many years, along with her TA's. Some of their content is even being used in this very syllabus. Thank you!


## Course Destinations

Both STAT 545 and STAT 547M make use of the following tools:

1. This "Classroom" website. 
    - Think of this as the course "home" -- and this syllabus as your launch pad to other destinations. 
    - Contains lecture notes, assignments, and course information.
2. [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) GitHub repository.
    - For internal discussion. The world cannot see this.
3. [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) GitHub repository.
    - For public discussion. The world can see this.
4. [STAT545-UBC-students](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students) GitHub Organization.
    - This will contain one GitHub repository per student, for you to submit homework to and give peer reviews.
5. [UBC canvas](http://canvas.ubc.ca/)
    - This is for grade management. You'll be interacting with it by submitting a link to your homework. 
6. <http://stat545.com>.
    - This holds course content, such as tutorials. Think of this as a textbook. We'll point you there when needed. 
    - Previously contained the information contained in `Classroom`. That eventually became confusing. Some headers there are becoming deprecated.

## Evaluation

To gain marks in this course, you'll be completing five assignments, and submitting two peer reviews for each assignment. Participation counts too!

Here's the breakdown of your course grade:

| Assessment | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| 5 Assignments | 75% (15% per assignment) |
| 10 Peer Reviews | 15% (3% per assignment) |
| Participation | 10% |

There is no final exam. 

Auditing students must still complete and submit all assessments, to be graded on a pass/fail basis. 

__Assignments and peer review__: For information about and links to assignments and peer reviews, go to [the `assignments` folder](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/assignments). 

__Participation__: will be evaluated by:

- Participation in class discussions
- Submitting work on in-class activities to your STAT 545 home GitHub repository.
    - Be sure to submit these in class, not at some other time!
- Activity in the Issues of the two `Discussion` repositories -- with preference given to [`Discussion`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion)  (public) over [`Discussion-Internal`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private).

## Conversation

We strongly encourage you to communicate with the teaching team _and_ your classmates. The best way to do this is by posting an Issue in one of the two `Discussion` GitHub repositories:

1. Want to talk about content/coding issues? Post an Issue in the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) (public) repository.
2. Want to talk about the course? Post an Issue in the [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private) repository.
3. Want to privately contact Vincenzo? Feel free to send me an email.
    - I look forward to receiving your email, though I do encourage you to post in one of the `Discussion` repositories unless it's really not appropriate for either platform. 

__Note__:

- To get the attention of the teaching team, add the `@2018_teaching_team` tag to notify all five of us.
- To get the attention of your fellow students, add the `@2018_students` tag to notify them.
- Don't just create Issues -- also respond to them! Think about this in terms of adding to the conversation, not in terms of "correctness". 

## Annotated Resources

Here are the resources we will be referring to throughout the course, along with a brief description of the resource. 

Overarching resources:

1. <http://stat545.com>
    - As mentioned earlier, this website can be thought of as a textbook for STAT 545/547.
2. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (aka "r4ds"), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
    - STAT 545/547 closely mirrors the topics of this book, making this book more of a true "textbook" for the course.

Resources for more specific topics:

1. R packages
2. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham
    - If you want to learn more about R as a programming language, this is a very readable and concise way of doing so.
