# Assignments and Peer Review

Assignments will be posted here as they are made available. 

## Schedule

Here are the deadlines for assignments and peer reviews, with links (to appear after assignments are released). All submissions are due by 11:59pm.

## Logistics

Here is the general flow that will happen for the assignments and peer reviews. 

1. When an assignment is released, I will post a GitHub Issue in [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal), tagging the teaching team and students (you should get an email notification, too, unless you've somehow disabled this).
2. You develop your homework responses on your STAT545 home GitHub repository, contained in the [STAT545-UBC-students](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students) Organization.
3. When your homework is complete, tag a release of your repository before the deadline, and submit a link to the release on [UBC canvas](canvas.ubc.ca).
4. You will be notified of two classmates to provide a peer review. Check out their submission, then write your feedback as an Issue in their repository before the deadline.
    - There is no need to tag the teaching team!

## Assignments

Components of each assignment will be graded on a 3-point scale. Here is the general rubric (*also consult any specific guidance given in the relevant assignment itself*).

Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|----| ------ |-------| -----|
|Coding style| Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable|
|Coding strategy| Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors  | Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some "hacking" instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors. |   Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors. |
|Presentation: graphs | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point | Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels. | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions. |
|Presentation: tables | Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features. | Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.| Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.|
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.|Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.|Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.|
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work|Access as easy as possible, code runs! | Satisfactory | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions  and/or code does not run|

## Peer Review

As part of this course you will be reviewing, commenting on, and marking other students' assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course and you will be marked on your peer reviews (15% of overall course mark).

### How to do peer review well: 

* Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments. 
* Be specific and concise.
* Use the assignment rubric (above) for ideas about criteria to evaluate and comment on -- we've given you a template to work with [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/assignments/blob/master/peer-review-template.md).
* Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.
* If you can't find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.

### How you will be marked: 

* It's binary. Each peer review will be deemed "good" or "needs more".

* Hallmarks of "needs more" feedback:
	- Your review is so generic that it's hard to determine which assignment you're reviewing.
    - Your review is mean.
    - You can't find anything to praise/learn and yet you don't offer any suggestions either.

* Each review you do will get you 1 point if "good" and 0 points if "needs more". Those will be totalled over all assignments to form your peer review mark.

### Additional resources:

Peer reviewing and critiquing others' work is a useful skill to develop during your graduate studies. Although these links deal mainly with the peer review of academic papers, most of the key points are applicable to our peer review process.
