## Logistics

Here is the general flow that will happen for the assignments and peer reviews. 

1. When an assignment is released, I will post a GitHub Issue in [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal), tagging the teaching team and students (you should get an email notification, too, unless you've somehow disabled this).
2. You develop your homework responses on your STAT545 home GitHub repository, contained in the [STAT545-UBC-students](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students) Organization.
3. When your homework is complete, tag a release of your repository before the deadline, and submit a link to the release on [UBC canvas](canvas.ubc.ca).
4. You will be notified of two classmates to provide a peer review. Check out their submission, then write your feedback as an Issue in their repository before the deadline.
    - There is no need to tag the teaching team!
